Share_my_weather
================

Playing a lil bit with ios. To show the my process from beginnig to end.
First reposetory contains only the "model" and basic stuff of fetching data from the "Open weather" api.
I think im gonna design it as the "Weather App" of Ryan Nystrom, realy like that clean look. Only i think ill just use storyboard.
